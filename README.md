# Heart-Prediction-Model
Analytics and machine learning solution as an alternative approach to initial heart disease detection
Today, most healthcare institutions employ non-invasive medical tests (no health risks) for initial heart disease detection. The results of such initial testing informs medical professionals whether or not an individual is likely to have heart disease, before proceeding with the complicated series of medical tests needed to conclusively diagnose heart disease. Therefore, such initial tests are crucial in determining whether the right individuals (those who actually have heart disease) end up getting the necessary intervention and treatment. However, research has shown that current non-invasive procedures have poor accuracy in predicting heart disease. The consequences of such misdiagnosis are severe. For instance, individuals with heart disease may not be identified, developing irreversible complications. Therefore, there is an important need to develop better methods for initial heart disease detection. In this project, we analyse the efficacy of 3 supervised machine learning models; Logistic Regression, Classsification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest. We then analyse the performance of each model and draw conclusions on the feasibility and applicability of each model.
